# Skyvelutter
A simple declarative gui library for forge 1.8.9 oriented for developer experience.

Manage your guis using xml, and layout elements like flutter. Link model and view by using on: bind: directives, a grammar inspired by svelte. Use rich collection of pre-built elements, like RichText/TextSpan.


WIP, still needs to decouple some stuff from dg.
